# Interpretation-of-WellLog-Data
# Displaying-Lithology-Data

### Project Overview
The project involved creating well plots using Matplotlib by extracting and processing well log data. The project focused on visualizing subsurface geological formations, enhancing data interpretation accuracy, and automating the generation of detailed plots for reservoir characterization.

### Data Sources
WellData : It includes well log data of depth, gamma ray, sonic log, density log and neutron porosity.

### Tools
Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib

### Data Visualization
